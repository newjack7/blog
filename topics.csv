Thomas de Carleton, Hugh de Stokes and John Judekyn, however, substituted the names of Hugh de Stokes and John Judekyn for William Virly and Richard son of Martin on the indenture that had been presented to the sheriff of Lincolnshire. Asaresult, the same Hugh and John Judekyn obtained a writ for expenses of £4 4s in connection with their stay of 21 days at the Parliament and attached goods and chattels of the citizens of [Lincoln] at Boston and thereby received 42s, even though they had not been chosen by the mayor and community of Lincoln. Thomas was under sheriff, Hugh de Stokes was clerk of the sheriff and John Judekyn was riding bailiff (‘threthingarius’)."
