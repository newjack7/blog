<p>Parse the text and include detailed part of speech tag. Not sure if this makes much difference but I will try it and see.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>detailTag &lt;- spacy_parse(txt, tag = TRUE)

verbDetails &lt;- detailTag %&gt;% filter(pos == &#39;VERB&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Now I need to join this to the ID from the original volume so I can cross-check the references and work out what analysis I can carry out with it.</p>

<pre><code>## Joining, by = &quot;UUID&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now I have all the verbs from the document and their tense, mood, and number assigned to the ID from the original volume which is easier to read the the UUID. Now I will do some counts to see the most prevalent types of verb and then another to see the most common verbs.</p>

<p>There are a few interesting verbs here. A couple require some further exploration. To look at the text alongside the verbs I will append the two together for easy reference. I want to specifically look at the word ‘see’. This occupies such a high position as it is used by the original editor Bernard McLane to draw links between allegations. For example McLane would refer to other similar crimes by the same perpetrator. If that was always the case then it might be possible to automate these linkages.</p>

This grain and malt was taken to Burton on Stather and Gainsborough, where it was sold, so that the king had no profit from it. [See 57 above and 742, 743,1050,1051,1064 and 1174 below.]

Even though Alice obtained a writ of entry to the lands, Gilbert would not honor the writ until Alice paid Master Robert de Berghdone, his clerk, a fine of Â£8 on one occasion through Henry de Halton, knight, Â£8 on a second occasion through John Bernard and Â£21 6s 8d on a third occasion through Richard de Bolingbrok.

They also took all the oats and hay in the same vill and took fish (100s) from the pond in Washingborough at night. They sent most of the fish to Master Williamâ\200\231s house in Bedfordshire, and also took 40s in small coins. [See 30 above.]

William de Swynford and Roger on 6 Aug. 1339 came to Branston and ejected William son of John from the holdings in question. Later on the following quindene of Michaelmas William de Swynford, with Rogerâ\200\231s consent, appeared in court and presented a writ nisi prius for a later date, at which time the jurors did not appear. On this date William de Swynford at Cold or Potter Hanworth with force and arms threatened to set fire to the house of John de Thomehill, one of the jurors, who thereby could not go to Lincoln until he paid 40s to William de Swynford and Edward, Williamâ\200\231s brother. William son of John was later awarded the land, but William de Swynford still holds it. [Roger did not appear before the justices: see 1109 below.]

Later Thomas and his wife took [blank] from Herbert to return a panel of lesser men who were in Herbertâ\200\231s keeping. Thomas thus is a champerter and an â\200\230ambidextrousâ\200\231.

He shipped the grain to Burton on Stather and Gainsborough, where he kept it for 72 more than 2 years, and later sold it, so that the king received no profit nor did Gilbert pay William or the vill.

He took 100s from the abbot of Kirkstead to empanel a jury of his choosing in a suit concerning Wildmore Fen between the 1 Marginal and textual note. 82 abbot and Sir William de Ros and also took 40s from William in the same suit. He thus took Â£100 to do his duty from abbots, priors and the whole community to the grave destruction and impoverishment of the people during the more than 2 years he was sheriff. [See 819 above.]

They also took more than 4 stones for each sack, the fleece and 6d for acquittance.

He maliciously vexed [the innocent] from place to place and would not allow them to be purged or acquitted until they paid fines. He thus in 13 Edward III took 6 marks from William Stanhard and the same from many others. He did the same concerning wills and sequestered the goods of the dead until the executors paid fines to the damage of 1,000 marks to the community. [See 825 above.]

Henry de Tyddeswell and Robert de Ascheburn &lt;not yet convicted &gt; on 22 Aug. 1336 at Lincoln by threats maliciously forced Robert to return the bond to Walter and took the wool in Robertâ\200\231s name against his will and sold it for Â£300. Later they obtained a bond in the kingâ\200\231s name for Robert for Â£200, but kept more than Â£100 in deception of the king and to the impoverishment of Robert, who has been prosecuted in the royal courts by his creditors to his grave damage.

Because she refused, Henry took 8 sacks 16 stones of wool at a weight of 14 lbs a stone and 28 stones a sack, when it should have been 26 stones a sack, and the fleece for each sack for the kingâ\200\231s use at 10 marks a sack. The wool was supposed to be paid for in 2 terms, but Henry did not pay for them. [See 709 above.]

When asked how they wished to acquit themselves of the trespasses and oppressions, John and the others individually stated that they could not deny [the charges], but put themselves on the kingâ\200\231s mercy and were imprisoned. Led by the sheriff, they 113 later came [before the justices] and requested that they be allowed to pay fines and then paid fines as appears on the fine roll and were freed from prison.

## 268  Gilbert de Ledred, former escheator in Lincolnshire, was taken to respond, with John his brother and Robert de Berughton, his clerk, to the bill of Alice de Lacy, countess of Lincoln. [The countess complained that] she had obtained a royal writ, which was delivered to Gilbert on 2 Oct. 1336 at Boston and directed him to certify to the kingâ\200\231s court the lands in fee that had been held by the late Eble Lestrange, 116 Aliceâ\200\231s former husband, when he died. Henry de Halton, knight, John Bernard, knight, and Richard de Bolyngbrok [her attorney] made an agreement with Gilbert to expedite the proceedings and paid Gilbert 100s, John his brother 40s and Robert de Berughdon 20s. Gilbert, John and Robert, however, on 5 Oct. 1336 came to Bolingbroke and told the countess that they needed more money to proceed. She then paid Gilbert another 100s, John his brother 40s and Robert 20s, but later they left and refused to hold the inquest. The countess on 24 Oct. 1336 at Stow St Mary ordered Richard de Bolingbrok to complain and to ask that the inquest be held, but they refused. Gilbert then told the abbot of Barlings that if he would make surety for the countess to pay him 20 marks, John his brother 100s and Robert Â£4, they would hold the inquest. The abbot did so and on 28 Oct. 1338 at Lincoln the inquest was held. But Gilbert would neither place his seal on the record of the inquest nor send it to the kingâ\200\231s court until he was paid the 20 marks, John his brother the 100s and Robert the Â£4. They ordered Robert de Hacthorn and Richard de Bolingbrok to send the money to Lincoln by the abbot of Barlings and Thomas Home, the abbotâ\200\231s servant. In addition, the same John took 16s from the countess as a fee for his seal and Gilbert later took Â£4 8s 2d in rents and tenantsâ\200\231 payments for the following Michaelmas term from the countessâ\200\231 manor of Sedgebrook. Gilbert also would give neither the king nor the countess the profits of the manor in contempt of the king and to the countessâ\200\231 damage of Â£50. Gilbert appeared and did not deny the countessâ\200\231 complaint. It was ordered that the countess receive her damages and that Gilbert be imprisoned in the kingâ\200\231s prison in the custody of the constable of Lincoln castle until [?he paid the damages]. The countess, through Richard de Bolingbrok, her attorney, proceeded against John, Gilbertâ\200\231s brother, and Robert de Berughdon, but the sheriff reported that they had died. The countess later asked that she receive all of Gilbertâ\200\231s goods and chattels, except oxen and plough animals, and that she hold half his lands according to the statute until the damages were paid. The justices agreed to this arrangement on 17 Jan. 1341 at Lincoln. [See 464 and 840 above.]

William complained that Master Robert and William de Brampton on 17 Oct. 1337 at Sturton by Stow St Mary without reasonable cause sequestered wheat, barley, oats and other goods (Â£40) and also 6 horses, 6 oxen and 40 sheep (Â£11) for the next 6 weeks during which time Maud, Williamâ\200\231s wife, died intestate, so that William was unable to plough or plant his lands and thus lost the profits of 10 acres of land. The 40 sheep died for lack of food. Master Robert and William de Brampton also on 24 Oct. 1337 at Stow St Mary cited William to appear before them at St Maryâ\200\231s church, Stow St Mary, and when he did not appear, they excommunicated and vexed him to his damage of Â£20 and in breach of and to the treachery of the kingâ\200\231s crown. Master Robert and William de Brampton, through their attorney, appeared and denied any wrongdoing. They defended the sequestering of the goods and animals by the privilege and law of the holy church. They stated that Maud the former wife of William de Calwarthrop, a parishioner of the rector of Stow St 1 Damages and fees struck through. 2 Damages struck through. 121 Mary, had died intestate in the parish and that the goods, chattels and animals had been sequestered until the ordinary was consulted to determine their disposition. William de Brampton stated that he aided Master Robert in doing his duty, and they asked if they should respond to the bill of trespass. William de Calwarthorp stated that Master Robert and William de Brampton ought to respond according to the law and custom of the realm. The justices asked Master Robert and William de Brampton if they had anything else to state and they said no. Because it was the view of the court that the property of a deceased wife ought not be touched, William de Calwarthorp was awarded damages of Â£20 and it was ordered that Robert and William de Brampton be taken. Damages Â£20; c[lerkâ\200\231s fee] 20s.1 [See 767 above.]

Walter stated that he was not guilty and placed himself on the country. The jurors declared that Robert, wishing to kill Walter, assaulted him with a knife and pursued him from place to place and to a certain lane blocked by a cart. Walter could not flee any further and in self-defense and to escape death with a knife attacked Robert, who died. The jurors declared that Robert had been wounded in the front and that Walter could not have escaped.

Walter stated that he was not guilty and placed himself on the country. The jurors declared that Robert, wishing to kill Walter, assaulted him with a knife and pursued him from place to place and to a certain lane blocked by a cart. Walter could not flee any further and in self-defense and to escape death with a knife attacked Robert, who died. The jurors declared that Robert had been wounded in the front and that Walter could not have escaped. Therefore, Walter was returned to prison in the custody of the sheriff to await the kingâ\200\231s mercy. [See 305 above.] [See CPR 1340-1343, 536,4 Nov. 1342, for Denesoneâ\200\231s pardon.]

William complained that Master Robert and William de Brampton on 17 Oct. 1337 at Sturton by Stow St Mary without reasonable cause sequestered wheat, barley, oats and other goods (Â£40) and also 6 horses, 6 oxen and 40 sheep (Â£11) for the next 6 weeks during which time Maud, Williamâ\200\231s wife, died intestate, so that William was unable to plough or plant his lands and thus lost the profits of 10 acres of land. The 40 sheep died for lack of food. Master Robert and William de Brampton also on 24 Oct. 1337 at Stow St Mary cited William to appear before them at St Maryâ\200\231s church, Stow St Mary, and when he did not appear, they excommunicated and vexed him to his damage of Â£20 and in breach of and to the treachery of the kingâ\200\231s crown. Master Robert and William de Brampton, through their attorney, appeared and denied any wrongdoing. They defended the sequestering of the goods and animals by the privilege and law of the holy church. They stated that Maud the former wife of William de Calwarthrop, a parishioner of the rector of Stow St 1 Damages and fees struck through. 2 Damages struck through. 121 Mary, had died intestate in the parish and that the goods, chattels and animals had been sequestered until the ordinary was consulted to determine their disposition. William de Brampton stated that he aided Master Robert in doing his duty, and they asked if they should respond to the bill of trespass. William de Calwarthorp stated that Master Robert and William de Brampton ought to respond according to the law and custom of the realm. The justices asked Master Robert and William de Brampton if they had anything else to state and they said no. Because it was the view of the court that the property of a deceased wife ought not be touched, William de Calwarthorp was awarded damages of Â£20 and it was ordered that Robert and William de Brampton be taken.

<p>Another verb of interest is take. Spacy takes the text and parses it out by assigning a part of speech to each word. As part of this process it also lemmatises each verb. This means that words like ‘take’, ‘taken’, or ‘took’ will all be returned as ‘take’ for reasons of analysis. However it is still possible to see the original word and the tag presents the type of verb (‘infinitive’, past tense’, etc).</p>

William Fraunceys found the animals in The Bail in Lincoln and went to Hugh de Muskham, constable of Lincoln castle and then constable of the peace, to get the animals back.
