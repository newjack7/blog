      <description>The previous post was spent learning the basics of text mining and exploring some possible avenues for analysis. In this post I label each offence with as precise a date as possible. In future I will also label it according to particular categories. I can do the first by extracting days, month, or years from the text to new columns and the pairing these with the original text. Essentially the text of the trials is broken into smaller observations and sorted according to particular criteria, in thie case, dates.</description>

      <description>I was really looking forward to giving a paper at the International Medieval Congress at Leeds this year on text mining medieval court records on session 836 which was organised by Dr Claire Kennan and Dr Emma J. Wells. I had intended to use the process as an excuse to learn text mining using R. I thought it might be provide some material for my thesis and I am quite evangelical about the possibilities of text mining historical documents.</description>
