         <h1>Why you should use Zotero</h1>
         


<p><em>This post is based on a talk I gave to Information Services staff at the Templeman Library in March 2019.</em></p>
<p>Umberto Eco in his 1977 <em>How to Write a Thesis</em> spends over twenty pages outlining the various ways in which you should cite works pertinent to your research on index cards. While there is still a need to understand many of the principles that Eco outlines there is now a variety of software which should ease the practicalities of managing your references.</p>
<p>In this post I want to cover a few reasons why, if you are planning to use reference management software, you should choose Zotero. Most of these are practical. I worked part time in the University of Kent library services for over five years. Most of what follows is based on my experience of attempting to get various reference management software packages working for students in this time and my own usage of Zotero, Mendeley, and Endnotes for my personal research.</p>
<div id="why-you-should-use-zotero" class="section level1">
<h1>Why you should use Zotero</h1>
<div id="its-free-and-not-for-profit" class="section level2">
<h2>It’s free and not for-profit</h2>
<p>Zotero is free, open source, and not for profit. It was built by and for historians and was funded by a series of research grants from research organisations in the United States. You can pay a subscription for file storage but Zotero also allows you to bypass this easily. EndNote is owned by Clarivate (who also produce Web of Science) and Mendeley is owned by Elsevier. Both are for-profit. Elsevier in particular are noted for the high prices they charge universities which has led to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x">termination of subscriptions</a> by the University of California system, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/03/13/norwegian-universities-ditch-elsevier">Norway, Germany, and Sweden</a>. Mendeley, once taken over by Elsevier, began to encrypt any data stored by its users which made moving between platforms difficult. Mendeley <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/kB/mendeley_import">claimed it was intended to improve security</a> over their data but many <a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/2018/06/13/mendeley-encrypted-db">saw it as a dishonest move</a> to lock users into the platform.</p>
<p><em>I am also never using EndNote again after it began deleting an essay before my eyes during my masters year.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="it-can-be-accessed-through-a-variety-of-platforms" class="section level2">
<h2>It can be accessed through a variety of platforms</h2>
<p>*You can install and use Zotero without an account – although if you want to back up your data you will need to make one. If you make an account you can also seamlessly use Zotero across multiple machines.</p>
<p>*If you have an account you can use the Zotero website to manage and export references. This is much more clunky than the installed software.</p>
<p>*You can also access a great deal of the Zotero functionality through <a href="https://zbib.org/">ZoteroBib</a>. This won’t preserve your references beyond your session although you can export via a <a href="https://zbib.org/faq#where-is-my-bibliography-stored">very nifty sharing system</a>. I imagine this is more useful for researchers working on one-off projects. I have never tried it because I like the desktop software so much.</p>
<p>*You can use it on macOS, Windows, Linux, Google Docs, Word, LibreOffice, and Open Office.</p>
</div>
<div id="its-easy-to-add-references-to-your-library" class="section level2">
<h2>It’s easy to add references to your library</h2>
<p>*You can add through ISBN or DOI and apparently PMID or arVix but I have no idea what they are.
<img src="/img/addReference.png" /></p>
<p>*You can even <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/scan-books-into-zotero-from-your-iphone-or-ipad/">scan a barcode from a book on your phone</a> and it will appear in your library.</p>
<p>*It integrates very well with most academic search platforms because you can add via BibTeX, RIS, or RDF. Most major database searches allow you to mass export your results in these formats.</p>
<p>*The browser plug in works quite well with some platforms but will also allow you to capture and add a webpage. I find this especially useful for archive catalogues so I can create and sort a list of items to look at. It also integrates really well with Google Scholar.</p>
<p><img src="/img/ZoteroGoogle.PNG" />
<em>You can simply drag and drop PDFs into Zotero and it will </em>usually* find the reference information. I advise against this though as it takes up some of your free Zotero cloud storage (300mb free. You can pay $20 a month for 2GB). I add via <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325828616_Tutorial_The_Best_Reference_Manager_Setup_Zotero_ZotFile_Cloud_Storage">another method</a> and use a cloud based solution to store the PDF.</p>
<p>*It is also pretty easy, and sometimes necessary, to add references manually. While it is time consuming in comparison to the other methods it is still quicker than writing all of your footnotes by hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-in-word" class="section level2">
<h2>Using in Word</h2>
<p>*Within word, the only method I have used, you simply click add reference and begin by typing any element of the author or work you wish to cite. You can select the particular work you wish press enter and then type the required page number.
<img src="/img/wordPlugin.PNG" /></p>
<p>*If for some reason any of these methods introduces an incorrect reference it is easy to update even if you have added it to a document. You simply amend the reference within Zotero and tell the word plug-in to refresh and it will automatically change.</p>
<p>*These references will be automatically updated if you change referencing style or cut and paste within the same document or between documents.</p>
<p>*Once you have completed your writing you can simply compile a bibliography in a single click.</p>
</div>
<div id="as-a-research-tool" class="section level2">
<h2>As a research tool</h2>
<p>The first stage for me is to trawl library and archive searches and different online collections. From this I build up a large folder/sub-folder within Zotero. I can then go through each article and make notes within Zotero as a first pass to establish what is relevant or useful. You can tag each work based on different criteria. Some people find this useful but it’s not a feature I have used. You can also export all of these to a spreadsheet if you prefer to manage them this way. You can also export the notes, tags, and other information in a wide range of formats, including CSV.
You can <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/feeds">subscribe to journal feeds</a> through Zotero. This means it automatically updates when new issues are released. From these you can add them to your library or click straight through to read the article online. There is no need anymore to sign up for reminder emails.</p>
<p>This covers most of the ways I use Zotero. Its remarkably easy and once you are up and running it will literally save you days of time if you are in a research-heavy position. You can save, search, and sort a huge number of references very quickly. I have nearly 2,000 references from the course of my teaching and PhD work and I use it every day.</p>
